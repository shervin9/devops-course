## Objective

Demonstrate your understanding of basic Git operations by creating a simple repository, making changes, and pushing to GitHub.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Local Repository Setup

1. Create a new directory called `week2-git-assignment` on your local machine
2. Initialize a Git repository in this directory
3. Create a file called `README.md` with the following content:
   ```markdown
   # Git Basics Assignment

   ## Commands Learned
   - git init
   - git add
   - git commit
   - git status

   .vscode/
   .idea/
   *.swp

   # Log files
   *.log
   ```
5. Stage your changes
6. Commit your changes with an appropriate message

### Part 2: Adding Features

1. Create a new file called `about.md` with a brief introduction about yourself (name, interests, programming experience)
2. Create a file called `git-commands.md` with descriptions of at least 5 Git commands you've learned
3. Stage only the `git-commands.md` file
4. Commit with an appropriate message
5. Stage the `about.md` file
6. Commit with an appropriate message

3. Push your commits to GitHub
4. Verify that your files appear on GitHub
5. Make changes to the README.md file directly on GitHub by adding a "Skills Acquired" section
6. Pull the changes to your local repository

### Part 4: Documentation

Create a file called `reflection.md` with answers to the following questions:

1. What challenges did you face while completing this assignment?
2. What Git command do you find most useful and why?
3. How do you think version control improves the development workflow?
4. What are the advantages of a distributed version control system like Git?
